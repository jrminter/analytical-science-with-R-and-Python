My main areas of focus were electron microscopy, image analysis, and electron microanalysis using X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). I quickly learned that embracing automation and scripted analysis gave me more time to think about the meaning of the results I obtained and eliminated error-prone repetitive data processing. By the end of my career, I had embraced Donald Knuthâ€™s idea of Literate Programming, where the code to run the data analysis is embedded as code chunks in the report, automatically generating the results. Like many scientists who work in analytical laboratories, I found myself repeatedly writing the same code. By that time I had embraced both python and R, and had learned the benefit of collecting code into functions and packages maintained under version control and tested with unit tests. If you write the same code more than twice, incorporate it into a function and keep it in a package under version control. I also discovered that the python and R-stats communities were welcoming and had already solved many of the problems I needed to solve. There were packages that did much of what I needed to do and I could make my non-proprietary code available as a way of giving something back. My management supported these activities because most of the tools that I used were Open Source and we were always under severe budgetary constraints. My new workflow was both more enjoyable and more intellectually stimulating. As our headcount went down, I found like-minded individuals in the larger community helped me to continue to learn and grow. This benefitted all of our employers without revealing proprietary information. In this book I will show how to use these tools to make a more robust and reproducible data analysis. "],

If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!
